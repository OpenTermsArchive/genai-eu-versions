Terms of Service for consumers in the European Union
====================================================

Effective:January 26, 2026

**Welcome to Mistral AI!** We provide technology that enables access to and use of Mistral AI’s artificial intelligence models. These Terms of Service (these “**Terms**”) govern your personal use as an EU user of Mistral AI Studio, Le Chat, Mistral Code, and the other websites, products, services, and technologies we offer (the “**Mistral AI Products**”). If you are a consumer residing outside the European Union, the [Consumer Terms for the rest of the world](http://legal.mistral.ai/terms/row-consumer-terms) apply to you. If you are accessing the Mistral AI Products on behalf of a business or to integrate the Mistral AI Products with your own products or services that are distributed to third-party end users, please review our [Commercial Terms of Service](http://legal.mistral.ai/terms/commercial-terms-of-service) for the terms governing such use.

**Who we are and how to reach out to us.** The Mistral AI Products are provided by Mistral AI, a French limited joint-stock corporation, incorporated in Paris, under number 952 418 325, with VAT number FR95952418325, having its registered offices at 15 rue des Halles, 75001 Paris, France (“**Mistral AI**” or “**us**”). You can contact us at any time by using the chatbot available [on our Help Center](https://help.mistral.ai/) or by writing to support@mistral.ai.

**Key points.** Before you read our terms, here are 3 key points to have in mind:

*   As between you and Mistral AI, you own all rights to your Outputs, but please be aware that they may sometimes be inaccurate. **Always check information before using your Outputs.**
    
*   You must make sure you have the necessary third-party permissions before using any Input with any Mistral AI Product. 
    
*   Using Mistral AI Products to generate Outputs that are illegal or that infringe or otherwise violate third-party rights is prohibited. For more details, please refer to our [Usage Policy](http://legal.mistral.ai/terms/usage-policy).
    

**Contract.** We encourage you to read and understand these Terms and our [Usage Policy](http://legal.mistral.ai/terms/usage-policy) because by clicking on “I agree” (or any similar button or checkbox) when you create a Mistral AI account or by accessing or using any of the Mistral AI Products, you are agreeing to these Terms and our [Usage Policy](http://legal.mistral.ai/terms/usage-policy), which constitute a binding agreement between you and Mistral AI. 

1\. Accessing the Mistral AI Products
-------------------------------------

**Age requirements.** You must be at least thirteen (13) years old to use the Mistral AI Products. You must have parental or legal guardian permission if you are a minor creating a Mistral AI account. We will delete any Mistral AI account found to violate these requirements.

**Mistral AI accounts.** Some Mistral AI Products require a Mistral AI account. You must provide complete and accurate account information and promptly update your account if any of your information changes. Your account is intended for your individual use only and you may not share your account with any other person. The creation or use of multiple Mistral AI accounts by a single individual is strictly prohibited, including to bypass rate limits or any other restrictions. You may not make your account credentials (including any API keys) available to third parties, share individual login credentials or API keys between multiple users on an account, or resell or lease access to your account or API keys. You must promptly notify us at support@mistral.ai or through the [Help Center](https://help.mistral.ai/) in the event you detect any unauthorized or fraudulent access or use of your account.

2\. Subscribing to paid Mistral AI Products
-------------------------------------------

**Price.** The applicable pricing (including any applicable taxes) for each paid Mistral AI Product and the accepted means of payment are indicated on our [pricing page.](https://mistral.ai/pricing) The prices of the Mistral AI Products are indicated "all taxes included", with Value Added Tax (VAT) applied at the rate in force in your billing country on the date you subscribe to a Mistral AI Product. 

**Subscription process.** To use any paid Mistral AI Products, you must create a Mistral AI account, select your desired subscription plan, accept these Terms, and submit your order by clicking the “Pay Now”, or any similar button. Before submitting your order, you will have the opportunity to review and edit your subscription details (e.g., subscription type, API credit amount, billing information, etc.). The paid Mistral AI Products you subscribe to will be available once your order is confirmed.

**Subscription confirmation.** After placing your order, you will receive an automatic e-mail acknowledging your order. Upon the conclusion of these Terms, we will provide you with a confirmation email sent to the email address associated with your Mistral AI account. We recommend printing and retaining a copy of your order and these Terms for your own records. 

**Payment.** To pay for any Mistral AI Products, you must provide complete and accurate billing information and use a valid, accepted payment method. For paid subscriptions, we will automatically charge your payment method on each periodic renewal as set forth in your order until you cancel. You are responsible for all applicable taxes, and we will charge taxes when required. If your payment cannot be completed, we may downgrade or suspend your access to Mistral AI Products until payment is received.

**Cancellation.** You can cancel your subscription to a paid Mistral AI Product at any time via your Mistral AI account settings or the [Help Center.](https://help.mistral.ai/) Payments are non-refundable, except where required by law or when you exercise your right of withdrawal under Section 7 (Withdrawal). You will continue to have access to your subscription benefits until the end of your subscription period.

**Changes.** We may change our prices from time to time, including to reflect circumstances such as changes in Mistral AI Product offerings, changes in our business, or changes in the economic environment. If we increase our prices, we will give you at least thirty (30) days’ notice by email sent to the email address associated with your Mistral AI account and any price increase will take effect the next time your subscription renews following the notice period so that you can cancel if you do not agree to the price increase.

3\. Using Mistral AI Products
-----------------------------

**Mistral AI Products.** As between you and Mistral AI, we own all right, title, and interest in and to the Mistral AI Products. We grant you a non-exclusive right to access and use the Mistral AI Products solely in your personal capacity in compliance with these Terms, all applicable laws and regulations, and any other terms we post at [www.legal.mistral.ai/terms](https://legal.mistral.ai/terms/www.legal.mistral.ai/terms) (as may be updated from time to time). Certain Mistral AI Products are only available if you have a paid subscription.

**Restrictions.** When accessing or using the Mistral AI Products, you will not, and will not permit any other person to:

(b) Use the Mistral AI Products or Your Data in a manner that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any third party’s rights, including intellectual property or privacy rights, including intentionally using the Mistral AI Products to generate Outputs that infringe, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate third party rights;

**Usage limitations.** Your use of the Mistral AI Products may be subject to rate limits, depending on your subscription plan. Such rate limits are listed [on our pricing page](https://mistral.ai/pricing). If you reach these limits, your access to the Mistral AI Products will be temporarily suspended until the limits reset or you upgrade your subscription.

**Deactivation of features.** You can deactivate certain features from the Mistral AI Products by using the settings available on your Mistral AI account. 

**Sharing Conversation Links.** Certain Mistral AI Products provide you with the ability to share unique links to conversations with third-parties (each a “**Conversation Link**”). Conversations that are viewable via a Conversation Link will not include (a) your Mistral AI username (unless you expressly include it in the conversation), (b) any addition you make to the conversation after sharing it, or (c) any other conversation you may have with such Mistral AI product. Anyone with the Conversation Link will be able to view your conversation, including any person with whom your intended recipient shares the Conversation Link. We do not monitor or control who accesses your conversations via Conversation Links that you create. As such, it is your responsibility to ensure that you are comfortable sharing, and have the right to share, all information that is shared in the Conversation Link.

**APIs.** Certain Mistral AI Products allow you to use our APIs. You may only use our APIs (i) for your own personal needs and (ii) to incorporate them in products that you make available to third-party users in connection with the Mistral AI Products or Outputs, in accordance with these Terms.  

**Moderation.** We reserve the right to monitor your use of Mistral AI Products through automated means. This monitoring is conducted to ensure compliance with our terms and policies, including our Usage Policy, and to maintain the security and integrity of Mistral AI Products.

**Third-Party Services.** You may connect services provided by third-parties (each, a “Third-Party Service”), including Model Context Protocol Servers (“**MCP Servers**”), to Mistral AI Products. By enabling these connections, you grant us the permission to (a) access the Third-Party Services, (b) send your Input to the Third-Party Service, and (c) where applicable, retrieve, process and store the necessary data to use as Inputs to generate Outputs. You may only connect a Third-Party Service to a Mistral AI Product if you have all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to connect such Third-Party Service to Mistral AI Products in accordance with these Terms. You are responsible for maintaining access to the Third-Party Service for the duration of your subscription or your use of such features. Any use of a Third-Party Service is subject to the respective terms and conditions for the Third-Party Service, and you are solely responsible for complying with such terms and conditions. You acknowledge that Third-Party Services are not Mistral AI Products and Mistral AI is not responsible for any Third-Party Service or your use of any Third-Party Service, including any disruptions, data loss, or issues with Mistral AI Products arising from your use of the Third-Party Service. Furthermore, if you use a MCP Server to connect a Mistral AI Product to a Third-Party Service you acknowledge that Mistral AI has no control over such third-party MCP Server and bears no responsibility for your use of such MCP Server, or for how the MCP Server processes or interprets your Input. Third-Party Services may be incompatible with Mistral AI Products. You will find more details on the compatibility and interoperability of Mistral AI Products with Third-Party Services on our [Help Center](https://help.mistral.ai/). 

**Mandatory updates.**  During the term of these Terms, we will notify you of any updates that you will need to install in order to continue using the Mistral AI Products, including to maintain compliance of the Mistral AI Products to these Terms (“**Mandatory Updates**”), and provide clear installation instructions when necessary. We will inform you of the availability of Mandatory Updates and any consequences of not installing them. We will not be liable for any issues with your use of the Mistral AI Products arising solely from your failure to install Mandatory Updates, unless such failure results from our breach of our obligations under these Terms and/or the applicable law.

**Non-mandatory updates.** We may deploy non-mandatory updates for implementing enhancements or making available new features and will notify you via email, in your Mistral AI account, or other durable medium prior to such deployment. If an update materially impairs your use of the Mistral AI Products and we don’t provide an alternative, you may terminate these Terms and your Mistral AI account free of charge within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of the notification or the update’s effective date, whichever is later. Termination is your sole remedy and ends your access to the affected Mistral AI Products.

4\. Your Data
-------------

**Your Data.** You and your authorized users may provide input to the Mistral AI Products, such as prompts, content, or fine-tuning data (“**Input**”), and receive output from the Mistral AI Products based on such Input (“**Output**”). We refer to Input and Output collectively as “**Your Data**”. To the extent permitted by applicable law, as between you and Mistral AI, you (i) retain all ownership rights in Input and (ii) own all Output. We assign to you all right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output that we may have.

**Fine-Tuned Model.** Your rights to access or use models you fine-tuned using our fine-tuning API (the “Fine-Tuned Model”) will cease upon termination of your account. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fine-Tuned Model does not constitute an Output. We will not use the Fine-Tuned Model except to provide it to you under these Terms. 

**Responsibility for Your Data.** You are responsible for all Inputs and represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions required to provide Inputs to the Mistral AI Products. You are solely responsible for all use of the Outputs and evaluating the Outputs for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case. You must also not represent that any Output was generated by a human when it was generated by the Mistral AI Products.

**Output restrictions.** To the extent permitted by the applicable laws, you may not use image Outputs to develop or train any image generation product that competes with a Mistral AI Product.

**Feedback.** For certain Mistral AI Products, such as Le Chat, you have the option to provide feedback, such as by selecting "thumbs up" or "thumbs down” (“**Feedback**”). By providing Feedback, you acknowledge and agree that Mistral AI may use your Feedback, along with the associated Input and Output data, for the purpose of training our artificial intelligence models and improving the Mistral AI Products, to the extent strictly necessary. 

**How we use Your Data.** We do not use Your Data to train our artificial intelligence models except (a) when you (i) use Mistral AI Products under a free subscription, or are subscribed to Le Chat Pro or Le Chat Student, and (ii) you have not opted-out of training, (b) when you provide Feedback to us, or (c) when Your Data is flagged as part of our automated moderation or reported as prohibited content, in which case we may use Your Data to improve the Mistral AI Products and enforce our Usage Policy. You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted in Section 13 (Assignment), royalty-free, fully-paid license (with the right to sublicense to our delegates and subcontractors) to use Your Data for the purpose of (a) providing, maintaining and optimizing the Mistral AI Products, which includes debugging, assessing, reviewing, and correcting the performance of the Mistral AI Products, but excludes model training, (b) performing our obligations under these Terms or other terms located on our website at [www.legal.mistral.ai/terms](https://legal.mistral.ai/terms/www.legal.mistral.ai/terms), and (c) as applicable and solely in the cases provided in the previous sentence, to train our artificial intelligence models, each for the duration necessary to achieve the intended purposes.

**Similarity of Output.** Due to the nature of the Mistral AI Products, your Output may be similar or identical to the response generated for another user of the Mistral AI Products. We provide no guarantees that your Output will be unique. Any responses generated for other users by the Mistral AI Product are not considered your Output even if similar or identical to your Output.

**Output Accuracy.** Mistral AI Products are based on large language models (LLMs), a technology that is continually evolving. For this reason, Outputs may occasionally be inaccurate. Mistral AI Products are not authoritative or infallible sources of information. You should not rely on Output generated by Mistral AI Products as the sole source of truth or as a substitute for professional advice (e.g., legal, tax, or medical). Use the Mistral AI Products with caution: always verify the reliability, accuracy, and completeness of the Output before relying on it for personal or professional purposes or otherwise making it available to third parties (including publishing such Output).

**Third-Party Content.** When you use certain features on a Mistral AI Product, such as web-search, you may receive (a) your Output, and (b) content provided by third-parties in the form of additional resources such as hyperlinks, images, thumbnails, or snippets from third-parties to help you further explore or understand the Output (the “**Third-Party Content**”). Such Third-Party Content does not constitute Your Data and we do not grant you any rights to this Third-Party Content, other than viewing it. For clarity, we do not use the Third-Party Content you provide in Your Input or that is displayed in Outputs to train our artificial intelligence models. You are not allowed to use Third-Party Content displayed using our web-search feature to (i) copy, store, archive, cache or create a database of the Third-Party Content, (ii) redistribute, resell, or sublicense the Third-Party Content, (iii) as part of any machine learning or similar algorithmic activity, or (iv) to create, train, evaluate or improve commercial products or services that you make available to third-parties.

**Prohibited content.** You must promptly report to us any of Your Data or Third-Party Content that you identify at any time as violating our [Usage Policy](http://legal.mistral.ai/terms/usage-policy) or which otherwise (a) incites hate, violence, or discrimination against individuals based on their origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc., (b) glorifies sexual harassment, (c) violates human dignity (e.g., human trafficking), (d) glorifies crimes against humanity or denying their existence, (e) incites terrorism, (f) glorifies very serious crimes against individuals (e.g., murder or sexual assault), (g) glorifies crimes involving theft, extortion, or material damage posing a danger to individuals, (h) constitutes child abuse sexual material, or (i) are dangerous for minors. You can report such content by using the report feature in the Mistral AI Products and/or by sending an email at support@mistral.ai. You grant us the right to access the reported content to improve the Mistral AI Products (e.g., to help us prevent the Mistral AI Products from generating such content again). This right is granted worldwide and for the duration of the intellectual property rights under applicable law. Where applicable, you must delete such content using the applicable feature on the Mistral AI Products.

5\. Warranties; Disclaimer
--------------------------

**Our Warranties.** We warrant that, when used in accordance with these Terms, the Mistral AI Products will conform in all material respects with the documentation we provide to you or otherwise make publicly available. Along with any commercial warranty provided under these Terms, you may also have legal rights in relations to the Mistral AI Products, including any warranties listed in Appendix 2 of these Terms.  

**Your Warranties.** You warrant that (a) you have the authority to enter into and accept these Terms, and (b) you and your authorized users (if any) will use the Mistral AI Products in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and these Terms.

**Disclaimer.** EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 5 (WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMER) AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE MISTRAL AI PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (A) THAT USE OF THE MISTRAL AI PRODUCTS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, SECURE, OR BE SUITABLE FOR YOUR SPECIFIC PURPOSES OR USE-CASES, (B) THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR (C) THAT THE OUTPUTS WILL BE ACCURATE. THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS DO NOT PREVAIL OVER THE MANDATORY CONSUMER PROTECTION REGULATIONS AND DO NOT EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE THE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO EXERCISE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL IN PROVIDING MISTRAL AI PRODUCTS OR OUR BREACH OF THESE TERMS, PROVIDED THAT THESE ARE DAMAGES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN FORESEEN AT THE TIME THE OBLIGATION AROSE.

6\. Liability
-------------

**Liability.** Our liability for any loss or damage suffered by you in connection with these Terms and/or the use of Mistral AI Products is limited to losses or damages that are a foreseeable result  of our breach of these Terms or our negligence. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time you entered into these Terms. We are not liable for losses caused by events beyond our reasonable control. In no event shall we exclude or limit liability for death, personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded under applicable consumer protection laws. These terms do not affect your legal rights as a consumer.

7\. Withdrawal
--------------

**Withdrawal right.** In accordance with your right of withdrawal, you have the right to cancel your subscription within fourteen (14) days from the date of your subscription (the “**Withdrawal Period**”). After this Withdrawal Period, your right to cancel will no longer apply. To exercise your right to withdraw within the Withdrawal Period, you must notify us of your decision to cancel before such period expires. You can do this by canceling your subscription directly through your account settings and reaching out to us at [support@mistral.ai](mailto:support@mistral.ai). If you wish to cancel your subscription in accordance with your right of withdrawal, you can use the following form provided in Appendix 1. 

**Effects of withdrawal.** If you cancel the subscription in accordance with your right of withdrawal, we will refund all payments made by you without undue delay and in any event not later than fourteen (14) days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

8\. Data Switching 
-------------------

**Switching**. You have the right to switch to another service provider or your own infrastructure. If you want to delete your data and digital assets, please use the automated procedure described on our [Help Center](https://help.mistral.ai/).

**Exportable data and digital assets.** You may export your data and digital assets via the export features provided on your Mistral AI Account, which includes at least your Le Chat conversations (prompts and outputs). Access to these export features enables you to complete the switching process in respect of such data and digital assets. In any case, data and digital assets that do not belong to you, such as our proprietary products, technologies and data, do not constitute exportable data and digital assets.

**Switching Request.** For any data and digital asset which is not included in the export features provided on your Mistral AI Account, you may exercise this right by writing  to Mistral AI at support@mistral.ai with all information necessary to fulfil the request (the “Switching Request”). Please ensure to submit your Switching Request two (2) months before your planned switching date (the "Notice Period"), and you must inform us of your new service provider or on-premise infrastructure at least 30 days before the end of the Notice Period.

**Transitional Period.** Assuming your Switching Request is complete, the switch will be completed within thirty (30) days following the end of the Notice Period (the “Transitional Period”), subject to any extension you or we can require.

**Mistral AI’s Obligations.** Until you notify us of your successful switch,  we will continue (a) providing you access to your data and digital assets, including through the self-serve export tool, which constitutes the assistance we provide to facilitate the switching process; (b) acting with due care to maintain business continuity, and continue the provision of Mistral AI Products; and (c) ensure the security and integrity of your data at every stage of the switching process. You are also informed that switching is performed solely by making your data and digital assets available to you and does not affect the provision of the Mistral AI Products until the end of your subscription; accordingly, no material continuity risks are expected in our provision of the Mistral AI Products.

**Retrieval Period.** Once you have exported your data and digital assets, or following the Transitional Period, Mistral AI will retain them for a period of at least thirty (30) days. 

**Data Erasure.** Once you have notified us of your successful switch Mistral AI will permanently erase all your data and digital assets, unless retention is required under applicable law.

**Liability.** Mistral AI does not warrant that the exported data and digital assets, or any specific data format, will be compatible, interoperable, or fit for use with the infrastructure, systems, software, or services of other service providers or any on-premise infrastructure.

**Termination.** These terms shall be considered terminated, and you will be notified accordingly, upon your notification of successful completion of the switch.

9\. Term, Suspension, and Termination
-------------------------------------

**Term.** These Terms will commence on the earlier of (a) the date you first use the Mistral AI Products or (b) the date you accept these Terms, and will continue until terminated.

**Termination or suspension.** We reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate your Mistral AI account and/or your access to all or part of the Mistral AI Products if: (a) you breach these Terms or our policies (including our [Usage Policy](https://legal.mistral.ai/terms/usage-policy)), (b) you fail to pay any fees when due, (c) to comply with applicable law, or (d) your continued use of the Mistral AI Products could cause risk or harm to Mistral AI, our users, or anyone else. If you believe we have suspended or terminated your account in error, you can file an appeal with us by contacting us via [support@mistral.ai](mailto:support@mistral.ai).

**Requests to terminate.** You can delete your account or terminate these Terms at any time by using the feature available on your account or, if unavailable, via our [Help Center](https://help.mistral.ai/) accessible in your account.

**Effects of termination.** Prior to the termination of your Mistral AI account, you must pay all outstanding fees, including any unpaid invoices and other charges incurred up to the termination date. You may not be able to export Your Data after your account is terminated, so if you would like to export Your Data, please complete the export prior to the termination of your account. Termination or expiration will not affect any rights or obligations, including the payment of amounts due, which have accrued under these Terms up to the date of termination or expiration. Upon termination or expiration of these Terms, the provisions of these Terms that are intended by their nature to survive termination will survive and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, including payment obligations and termination provisions.

10\. Privacy
------------

**Privacy Policy.** We process your personal data as a data controller for the purposes of (a) providing the Mistral AI Products to you and (b) managing your relationship with us in accordance with these Terms, including any billing, payment, or marketing activities.

**Notice.** We will give you at least thirty (30) days advance notice of changes to these Terms that are expected to materially impact you either via email or an in-product notification. All other changes will be effective as soon as we post them at [www.legal.mistral.ai/terms](https://legal.mistral.ai/terms/www.legal.mistral.ai/terms). If you do not agree to the changes, you can terminate these Terms at any time, but you must stop using our Mistral AI Products as soon as the changes enter into force.

12\. Governing law and dispute resolution
-----------------------------------------

**Governing law and venue.** Subject to any mandatory legal restrictions under the laws of your country of residence, these Terms are governed by French law and any litigation arising out of or in connection with these Terms, whether contractual, tortious, or otherwise, shall be brought exclusively before the competent courts of Paris, France, and shall be governed by French law. You may also bring claims before the courts of your country of residence and, where permitted by law, such claims shall be governed by the substantive law of your country of residence.

**Mediation.** You retain the right to initiate a mediation process in the event of a dispute. Mediation may be conducted through the CMAP (Centre de Médiation et d’Arbitrage de Paris), contactable:

------------

**Your rights.** You will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the laws of your country of residence or domicile and nothing in these Terms shall affect your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of the laws of your country of residence or domicile.

**Statistics.** We may create aggregated and anonymized statistics (“Usage Data”) based on your use of the Mistral AI Products, which we use solely to conduct research or to enhance product performance, functionality, and user experience. Usage Data is the sole property of Mistral AI and does not constitute Your Data. Any such Usage Data is never used to identify you. 

**Assignment.** You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms and any attempt to do so will be void. We may assign our rights or obligations under these Terms to any affiliate, subsidiary, or successor in interest of any business associated with our Mistral AI Products, provided that such assignment does not materially affect your rights under these Terms nor have the effect to diminish or undermine your consumer rights.

**Force Majeure.** Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms (except for a failure to pay fees) if such delay or failure is due to unforeseen events beyond the reasonable control of such party.

**Independent Contractors.** There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency created between the parties under these Terms. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.

**No Third-Party Rights.** There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.

**Waivers.** No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or of any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**Entire Agreement; Severability.** Unless otherwise agreed in writing between you and Mistral AI, these Terms, including our [Usage Policy](http://legal.mistral.ai/terms/usage-policy), constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning your use of the Mistral AI Products. Any statements or comments made between you and any of our employees or representatives are expressly excluded from these Terms and will not apply to you or us, or to your access to or use of the Mistral AI Products absent a separate written agreement. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.

14\. Mobile applications
------------------------

**General.** If you wish to access any Mistral AI Products made available as a mobile application (each, a “Mistral AI App”), you must have a compatible mobile device. Mistral AI currently makes Mistral AI Apps available for certain mobile device types in the (a) Apple App Store (each, an “iOS App”) and (b) Google Play Store (each, an “Android App”). Mistral AI does not warrant that any particular Mistral AI App will be compatible with your specific device. Use of a Mistral AI App with your mobile device may result in charges from your mobile service provider, such as for the use of wireless data. You agree that you are solely responsible for any such mobile service provider charges.Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Mistral AI hereby grants you a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, and revocable license to use a compiled code copy of each Mistral AI App on each personal mobile device that you own or control (or such additional shared use as permitted by Apple or Google in their terms referenced below):

### Appendix 2 - Country Specific Terms

### 1\. For consumers residing in France

Along with any commercial warranty provided under these Terms, if you reside in France, you will also benefit from the following legal warranty:

“Le consommateur a droit à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité en cas d’apparition d’un défaut de conformité durant la période de la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique. Durant ce délai, le consommateur n’est tenu d’établir que l’existence du défaut de conformité et non la date d’apparition de celui-ci. La garantie légale de conformité emporte obligation de fournir toutes les mises à jour nécessaires au maintien de la conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique durant la durée d’enregistrement du compte du consommateur sur la plateforme. La garantie légale de conformité donne au consommateur droit à la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique sans retard injustifié suivant sa demande, sans frais et sans inconvénient majeur pour lui. Le consommateur peut obtenir une réduction du prix en conservant le contenu numérique ou le service numérique, ou il peut mettre fin au contrat en se faisant rembourser intégralement contre renoncement au contenu numérique ou au service  numérique, si :

1.  Le professionnel refuse de mettre le contenu numérique ou le service numérique en conformité ;
    
2.  La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique est retardée de manière injustifiée ;
    
3.  La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique ne peut intervenir sans frais imposés au consommateur ;
    
4.  La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service  numérique occasionne un inconvénient majeur pour le consommateur ;
    
5.  La non-conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique persiste en dépit de la tentative de mise en conformité du professionnel restée infructueuse.
    

Le consommateur a également droit à une réduction du prix ou à la résolution du contrat lorsque le défaut de conformité est si grave qu’il justifie que la réduction du prix ou la résolution du contrat soit immédiate. Le consommateur n’est alors pas tenu de demander la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique au préalable. Dans les cas où le défaut de conformité est mineur, le consommateur n’a droit à l’annulation du contrat que si le contrat ne prévoit pas le paiement d’un prix. Toute période d’indisponibilité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique en vue de sa remise en conformité suspend la garantie qui restait à courir jusqu’à la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique de nouveau conforme. Ces droits résultent de l’application des articles L. 224-25-1 à L. 224-25-31 du code de la consommation. Le professionnel qui fait obstacle de mauvaise foi à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité encourt une amende civile d’un montant maximal de 300 000 euros, qui peut être porté jusqu’à 10 % du chiffre d’affaires moyen annuel (article L. 242-18-1 du code de la consommation). Le consommateur bénéficie également de la garantie légale des vices cachés en application des articles 1641 à 1649 du code civil, pendant une durée de deux ans à compter de la découverte du défaut. Cette garantie donne droit à une réduction de prix si le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est conservé, ou à un remboursement intégral contre renonciation au contenu numérique ou au service numérique."

2\. For consumers residing in Germany
-------------------------------------

**Legal warranty.** Along with any commercial warranty provided under these Terms, if you reside in Germany, you will also benefit from the following legal warranty:

The Consumer’s action to assert a lack of conformity not maliciously concealed by us shall in any event be time-barred within 26 (twenty-six) months from the time of supply.

In the event of lack of conformity, the Consumer is entitled, without additional cost, to have the service or content brought into conformity or to a proportionate price reduction or to terminate the contract, as applicable. You can contact us for exercising your rights under the legal warranty by using our contact details or the form available at [https://mistral.ai/contact](https://mistral.ai/contact).

You may only connect a Third-Party Service to a Mistral AI Product if you have all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to connect such Third-Party Service to Mistral AI Products in accordance with these Terms. You are responsible for maintaining access to the Third-Party Service for the duration of your subscription or your use of such features. Any use of a Third-Party Service is subject to the respective terms and conditions for the Third-Party Service, and you are solely responsible for complying with such terms and conditions. You acknowledge that Third-Party Services are not Mistral AI Products and Mistral AI is not responsible for any Third-Party Service or your use of any Third-Party Service, including any disruptions, data loss, or issues with Mistral AI Products arising from your use of the Third-Party Service.

If an update materially impairs your use of the Mistral AI Products and we don’t provide an alternative, you may terminate these Terms and your Mistral AI account free of charge within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of the notification or the update’s effective date, whichever is later. Termination is your sole remedy and ends your access to the affected Mistral AI Products.

4\. Your Data
-------------

**Your Data.** You and your authorized users may provide input to the Mistral AI Products, such as prompts, content, or fine-tuning data (“**Input**”), and receive output from the Mistral AI Products based on such Input (“**Output**”). We refer to Input and Output collectively as “**Your Data**”. To the extent permitted by applicable law, as between you and Mistral AI, you (i) retain all ownership rights in Input and (ii) own all Output. We assign to you all right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output that we may have.

**Fine-Tuned Model.** Your rights to access or use models you fine-tuned using our fine-tuning API (the “Fine-Tuned Model”) will cease upon termination of your account. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fine-Tuned Model does not constitute an Output. We will not use the Fine-Tuned Model except to provide it to you under these Terms. 

**Responsibility for Your Data.** You are responsible for all Inputs and represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions required to provide Inputs to the Mistral AI Products. You are solely responsible for all use of the Outputs and evaluating the Outputs for accuracy and appropriateness for your use case. You must also not represent that any Output was generated by a human when it was generated by the Mistral AI Products.

**Output restrictions.** To the extent permitted by the applicable laws, you may not use image Outputs to develop or train any image generation product that competes with a Mistral AI Product.

**Feedback.** For certain Mistral AI Products, such as Le Chat, you have the option to provide feedback, such as by selecting "thumbs up" or "thumbs down” (“**Feedback**”). By providing Feedback, you acknowledge and agree that Mistral AI may use your Feedback, along with the associated Input and Output data, for the purpose of training our artificial intelligence models and improving the Mistral AI Products, to the extent strictly necessary. 

**How we use Your Data.** We do not use Your Data to train our artificial intelligence models except (a) when you (i) use Mistral AI Products under a free subscription, or are subscribed to Le Chat Pro or Le Chat Student, and (ii) you have not opted-out of training, (b) when you provide Feedback to us, or (c) when Your Data is flagged as part of our automated moderation or reported as prohibited content, in which case we may use Your Data to improve the Mistral AI Products and enforce our Usage Policy. You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as permitted in Section 13 (Assignment), royalty-free, fully-paid license (with the right to sublicense to our delegates and subcontractors) to use Your Data for the purpose of (a) providing, maintaining and optimizing the Mistral AI Products, which includes debugging, assessing, reviewing, and correcting the performance of the Mistral AI Products, but excludes model training, (b) performing our obligations under these Terms or other terms located on our website at [www.legal.mistral.ai/terms](https://legal.mistral.ai/terms/www.legal.mistral.ai/terms), and (c) as applicable and solely in the cases provided in the previous sentence, to train our artificial intelligence models, each for the duration necessary to achieve the intended purposes.

**Similarity of Output.** Due to the nature of the Mistral AI Products, your Output may be similar or identical to the response generated for another user of the Mistral AI Products. We provide no guarantees that your Output will be unique. Any responses generated for other users by the Mistral AI Product are not considered your Output even if similar or identical to your Output.

**Output Accuracy.** Mistral AI Products are based on large language models (LLMs), a technology that is continually evolving. For this reason, Outputs may occasionally be inaccurate. Mistral AI Products are not authoritative or infallible sources of information. You should not rely on Output generated by Mistral AI Products as the sole source of truth or as a substitute for professional advice (e.g., legal, tax, or medical). Use the Mistral AI Products with caution: always verify the reliability, accuracy, and completeness of the Output before relying on it for personal or professional purposes or otherwise making it available to third parties (including publishing such Output).

**Third-Party Content.** When you use certain features on a Mistral AI Product, such as web-search, you may receive (a) your Output, and (b) content provided by third-parties in the form of additional resources such as hyperlinks, images, thumbnails, or snippets from third-parties to help you further explore or understand the Output (the “**Third-Party Content**”). Such Third-Party Content does not constitute Your Data and we do not grant you any rights to this Third-Party Content, other than viewing it. For clarity, we do not use the Third-Party Content you provide in Your Input or that is displayed in Outputs to train our artificial intelligence models. You are not allowed to use Third-Party Content displayed using our web-search feature to (i) copy, store, archive, cache or create a database of the Third-Party Content, (ii) redistribute, resell, or sublicense the Third-Party Content, (iii) as part of any machine learning or similar algorithmic activity, or (iv) to create, train, evaluate or improve commercial products or services that you make available to third-parties.

**Prohibited content.** You must promptly report to us any of Your Data or Third-Party Content that you identify at any time as violating our [Usage Policy](http://legal.mistral.ai/terms/usage-policy) or which otherwise (a) incites hate, violence, or discrimination against individuals based on their origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc., (b) glorifies sexual harassment, (c) violates human dignity (e.g., human trafficking), (d) glorifies crimes against humanity or denying their existence, (e) incites terrorism, (f) glorifies very serious crimes against individuals (e.g., murder or sexual assault), (g) glorifies crimes involving theft, extortion, or material damage posing a danger to individuals, (h) constitutes child abuse sexual material, or (i) are dangerous for minors. You can report such content by using the report feature in the Mistral AI Products and/or by sending an email at support@mistral.ai. You grant us the right to access the reported content to improve the Mistral AI Products (e.g., to help us prevent the Mistral AI Products from generating such content again). This right is granted worldwide and for the duration of the intellectual property rights under applicable law. Where applicable, you must delete such content using the applicable feature on the Mistral AI Products.

Access to these export features enables you to complete the switching process in respect of such data and digital assets. In any case, data and digital assets that do not belong to you, such as our proprietary products, technologies and data, do not constitute exportable data and digital assets.

**Switching Request.** For any data and digital asset which is not included in the export features provided on your Mistral AI Account, you may exercise this right by writing  to Mistral AI at support@mistral.ai with all information necessary to fulfil the request (the “Switching Request”). Please ensure to submit your Switching Request two (2) months before your planned switching date (the "Notice Period"), and you must inform us of your new service provider or on-premise infrastructure at least 30 days before the end of the Notice Period.

**Transitional Period.** Assuming your Switching Request is complete, the switch will be completed within thirty (30) days following the end of the Notice Period (the “Transitional Period”), subject to any extension you or we can require.

**Mistral AI’s Obligations.** Until you notify us of your successful switch,  we will continue (a) providing you access to your data and digital assets, including through the self-serve export tool, which constitutes the assistance we provide to facilitate the switching process; (b) acting with due care to maintain business continuity, and continue the provision of Mistral AI Products; and (c) ensure the security and integrity of your data at every stage of the switching process. You are also informed that switching is performed solely by making your data and digital assets available to you and does not affect the provision of the Mistral AI Products until the end of your subscription; accordingly, no material continuity risks are expected in our provision of the Mistral AI Products.

**Retrieval Period.** Once you have exported your data and digital assets, or following the Transitional Period, Mistral AI will retain them for a period of at least thirty (30) days. 

**Data Erasure.** Once you have notified us of your successful switch Mistral AI will permanently erase all your data and digital assets, unless retention is required under applicable law.

**Liability.** Mistral AI does not warrant that the exported data and digital assets, or any specific data format, will be compatible, interoperable, or fit for use with the infrastructure, systems, software, or services of other service providers or any on-premise infrastructure.

**Termination.** These terms shall be considered terminated, and you will be notified accordingly, upon your notification of successful completion of the switch.

### Appendix 2 - Country Specific Terms

### 1\. For consumers residing in France

Along with any commercial warranty provided under these Terms, if you reside in France, you will also benefit from the following legal warranty:

“Le consommateur a droit à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité en cas d’apparition d’un défaut de conformité durant la période de la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique. Durant ce délai, le consommateur n’est tenu d’établir que l’existence du défaut de conformité et non la date d’apparition de celui-ci. La garantie légale de conformité emporte obligation de fournir toutes les mises à jour nécessaires au maintien de la conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique durant la durée d’enregistrement du compte du consommateur sur la plateforme. La garantie légale de conformité donne au consommateur droit à la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique sans retard injustifié suivant sa demande, sans frais et sans inconvénient majeur pour lui. Le consommateur peut obtenir une réduction du prix en conservant le contenu numérique ou le service numérique, ou il peut mettre fin au contrat en se faisant rembourser intégralement contre renoncement au contenu numérique ou au service  numérique, si :

1.  Le professionnel refuse de mettre le contenu numérique ou le service numérique en conformité ;
    
2.  La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique est retardée de manière injustifiée ;
    
3.  La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique ne peut intervenir sans frais imposés au consommateur ;
    
4.  La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service  numérique occasionne un inconvénient majeur pour le consommateur ;
    
5.  La non-conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique persiste en dépit de la tentative de mise en conformité du professionnel restée infructueuse.
    

Le consommateur a également droit à une réduction du prix ou à la résolution du contrat lorsque le défaut de conformité est si grave qu’il justifie que la réduction du prix ou la résolution du contrat soit immédiate. Le consommateur n’est alors pas tenu de demander la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique au préalable. Dans les cas où le défaut de conformité est mineur, le consommateur n’a droit à l’annulation du contrat que si le contrat ne prévoit pas le paiement d’un prix. Toute période d’indisponibilité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique en vue de sa remise en conformité suspend la garantie qui restait à courir jusqu’à la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique de nouveau conforme. Ces droits résultent de l’application des articles L. 224-25-1 à L. 224-25-31 du code de la consommation. Le professionnel qui fait obstacle de mauvaise foi à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité encourt une amende civile d’un montant maximal de 300 000 euros, qui peut être porté jusqu’à 10 % du chiffre d’affaires moyen annuel (article L. 242-18-1 du code de la consommation). Le consommateur bénéficie également de la garantie légale des vices cachés en application des articles 1641 à 1649 du code civil, pendant une durée de deux ans à compter de la découverte du défaut. Cette garantie donne droit à une réduction de prix si le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est conservé, ou à un remboursement intégral contre renonciation au contenu numérique ou au service numérique."

2\. For consumers residing in Germany
-------------------------------------

**Legal warranty.** Along with any commercial warranty provided under these Terms, if you reside in Germany, you will also benefit from the following legal warranty:

The Consumer’s action to assert a lack of conformity not maliciously concealed by us shall in any event be time-barred within 26 (twenty-six) months from the time of supply.

In the event of lack of conformity, the Consumer is entitled, without additional cost, to have the service or content brought into conformity or to a proportionate price reduction or to terminate the contract, as applicable. You can contact us for exercising your rights under the legal warranty by using our contact details or the form available at [https://mistral.ai/contact](https://mistral.ai/contact).
